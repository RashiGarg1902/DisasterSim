# DisasterSim
DisasterSim is a demo-grade web application for exploring disaster-relief decision-making in real time. Users can place and allocate resources, respond to generated events, and observe how morale and housing outcomes evolve across a simple map. The app highlights complex frontend concerns — state orchestration, animations, visualizations, and responsive UX — and is intended as a portfolio piece and interview demo to demonstrate engineering and design skills.
